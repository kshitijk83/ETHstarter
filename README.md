# ETHstarter - Fixing kickstarter issues of fraud

## What is kickstarter
Kickstarter PBC is a funding platform for creative projects. Kickstarter is website where anyone can raise and collect money to new build their innovative startup ideas (known as campaign). you just have to publish your idea and startup collecting donations and contributers.

## Problem with Kickstarter
Some malicious project owners don't spend there money in building their projects or don't have capability to manage the budget efficiently. In summary, money goes to project owner and then it's there choice whether to spend it for building that project(with the help of vendors) or flee.

## Solution
A simple solution of this is that we send money to an ethereum contract for a specific campaign. Then owner can only spend the money by sending it to a specified vendor's address. Now to enhance more security contributors/donators can vote if they a money spending to a vendor should be allowed or not(by checking the authenticity of vendor's ethereum account address), if voting passes a specific percentage the transaction is allowed to happen otherwise not.
